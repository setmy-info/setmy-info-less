# setmy-info-less

A modular and testable LESS-based styling framework for web projects. This project provides a structured system for
managing CSS using LESS, generating HTML with Pug, and ensuring quality through unit and end-to-end testing.

As SMI standard browser is Firefox, then values can be taken from FF development tool and make these similar for all
browsers.

## ðŸ“¦ Project

This project includes:

- `LESS` â€“ for managing styles
- `Pug` â€“ for generating HTML
- `Playwright` â€“ for end-to-end (e2e) testing
- `Jest` â€“ for JavaScript unit testing
- `Express` â€“ for simple local serving
- `npm scripts` â€“ for build and test workflows

**main.less** is starting point, that includes the rest of the files in correct order.

### Principles

UI is divided in (breaking point) groups:

* **Default** is PC or wide UI, no elements shrinking, collapsing and hiding needed. For full visibility.
* **Phone**: is usual pocket and handheld smartphone devices.
* **Pad** usually a little wider UI, that can handle more elements but not all. Something can be hidden/shrunken.
* **Watch** usually hand watch UI-s.
* **Print** system for printing.

Utility CSS classes are switches to apply some CSS rules on elements.

## Changed

Some classes were changed after 1.0.0 release. On case of using upgraded changes in depending code need to search and
replace.

* verticalStrechPanel -> verticalStretchPanel
* horisontalStrechPanel -> horizontalStretchPanel

+ some more other possible changes

## TODO

* Consider font correctness

```less
@fontFamily: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif;
```

* get rid of !important. Probably right order helps here.
