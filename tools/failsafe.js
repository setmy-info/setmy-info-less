// implement: `integration-test` and `e2e-test` NEVER fail the build where
// they run. A failure is RECORDED here and surfaced later by the matching
// `post-*-test` step - the same reason `mvn verify` splits
// failsafe:integration-test from failsafe:verify, with
// post-integration-test guaranteed to run in between.
//
// Without this, a failing e2e suite aborted the npm script chain, so
// post-e2e-test never ran and every server started by pre-e2e-test was
// left listening (report.md item 46 all over again, from the other end).
